	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is understood as the time taken by program to run and complete given task as a programer, your goal shuld to reduce the time complexity of the codwe by optimizzing it and make it more afficient   </p>
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. for Example, if a progrom takes and array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program become O(n)</p>
