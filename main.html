<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input. In other words, time complexity is essentially efficiency, or how much real time an algorithm needs to execute.</p>
<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. For example, if n is the space required by variables, then O(n) is the space complexity.</p>	<!-- the entire body must be written by student -->
