<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task, As a programmer, your goal shoud to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficent 
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. For example, if n is the space required by variables, then O(n) is the space complexity.</p>	<!-- the entire body must be written by student -->
